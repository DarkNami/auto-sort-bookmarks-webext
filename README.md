This extension provides a few options categorized within these categories:
* Main Options

* Display Options

These options work like this:

**Main Options:**

* **Auto-sort :** if this option is enabled, the bookmarks will be sorted when Firefox is opened, when this option is activated and when bookmarks are added, changed, moved or deleted.
This means you cannot move any bookmarks in the same folder, unless it is moved over a separator.
* **Delay:** allow to define a delay (in seconds) before automatically sorting bookmarks.
* **Delay for Folders:** allow to define a delay (in seconds) before automatically sorting folders. This is to avoid that a new folder is sorted before you can choose it when adding a new bookmark.

* **Sort Bookmarks Toolbar:** if this option is enabled, the bookmark toolbar will be sorted, otherwise, it will be ignored when sorting.
* **Sort Unsorted Bookmarks:** if this option is enabled, the unsorted bookmarks folder will be sorted, otherwise, it will be ignored when sorting.

* **Then Sort By:** allow to specify a second sort criteria (optional). For instance, if the first sort criteria is the name, it is possible to choose a second sort criteria to sort bookmarks with the same name.
* **Inverse Second Order:** if this option is enabled, the order specified in "Then Sort By" will be reversed.
